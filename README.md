# ICESat2_CSP
Precipitation over Antarctica plays a critical role in determining the mass balance of the ice sheet, yet it remains poorly quantified due to the harsh environment and sparse number of observations. Over the East Antarctic Plateau, clear-sky precipitation (CSP) is a significant portion of the total annual precipitation. CSP consists of very small ice crystals that form when the air becomes supersaturated and settle to the surface. This study presents the first continental-scale estimates of CSP over the East Antarctic Plateau using atmospheric backscatter profiles from the ICESat-2 lidar. A method is developed to identify CSP based on calibrated attenuated backscatter and to estimate the associated precipitation amounts by deriving ice water content from lidar extinction and using an estimated particle fall speed to obtain precipitation rate.
